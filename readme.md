This brings `window.crypto` to your React Native application. It does this by communicating with a hidden WebView, which performs the actual computation.

Refer to the [`webview-crypto`](https://github.com/saulshanabrook/webview-crypto) repo for most of the code and some caveats.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-native-webview-crypto
react-native link
```

## Android

create a file called blank.html in android/app/src/main/assets

```
<html/>
```

## Usage

Rendering the `PolyfillCrypto` will start up a WebView to transparently proxy all the crypto calls to.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";

import App from "./app";

import PolyfillCrypto from "react-native-webview-crypto";

class TopLevelComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <PolyfillCrypto />
        <App />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent("WhateverName", () => TopLevelComponent);
```

Now, in any of your code, you can access `window.crypto`, just like you would in a browser.

There is also an [example repo](https://github.com/saulshanabrook/react-native-webview-crypto-example) which runs some example crypto using this library.
